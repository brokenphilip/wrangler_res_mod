# Wrangler Resistance Modifier
A SourceMod plugin for Team Fortress 2 which allows you to modify the damage resistance of an Engineer's Sentry Gun protected by the Wrangler's shield on the fly, taking into consideration debuffs (sapped or "plasma-disabled" by the Cow Mangler) as well as resistance-piercing items (such as the Enforcer, or ones defined by a custom plugin).

# Requirements
- [TF2Attributes](https://github.com/FlaminSarge/tf2attributes)

# CVars
- `sm_wrangler_dmg_modifier <float>` - The % of damage a shielded sentry takes (ie. 0.33 (default) = 66% resistance)
